# SoC
This repository contains the code I've written each week after learning new topics as guided by my mentor. These problems are submitted by me, wx_qy means submitted in week x, question number y. It also contains practice problems that I've done in the form wx_py (similar except that p represents practice). I've also added all the resources that I've used provided by my mentor.
Even though summer is over, I'll try to complete the unsolved problems slowly.
